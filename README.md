# Tic Tac Toe

**4/100 of my App-A-Day challenge**

[Check it out live here.](https://tic-tac-toe.timinc.us/)

## What

A front-end implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game for play between two players on the same device. For the App-A-Day challenge, I tuned up the styling, adding a theme for both light and dark mode users which automatically switches based on your system preferences.

## How

* Uses React for the JS/HTML/CSS combo.
* Uses [React Toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) to make the :yum: toast.
