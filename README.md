# React Tic-Tac-Toe

## What is this?

It's a Tic-Tac-Toe game, made using React. A couple bells and whistles, including a toast to indicate the winner, and a little component to tell you to come back to this page if you want to know more.

## Why is this?

Beginners with React who enjoy picking through existing projects can use it to learn bits and pieces of React.

Whether you're new to React or not, I challenge you to make a better version than I've made here! While this one is functionally sound (as far as I'm aware), there are bits that can be done better. This was made in 2021 and uses a class in JavaScript, it can definitely be improved upon.

## How can I play?

Navigate to https://tmetcalfe89.github.io/tic-tac-toe/ and play with a friend right on your device. Yes, both players need to use the same device; there is no network functionality on this.
